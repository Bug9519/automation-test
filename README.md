# automation-test
Test repository for automating file changing and pushes to GitHub from Windows.

I plan on doing this by having a batch script run on my computer that will add 
the current date and time to a text file, that will be named DDMMYYYY.txt for each day, and then
the files will be pushed to this repository.

Each file will contain: 
DDMMYYYY - Date
HHMMSS - Time (24Hour)
12011 - Random Number
