# automation-test
Test repository for automating file changes and pushing to GitHub from Windows Command Prompt.

I plan on doing this by having a batch script run on my computer that will add 
the current date and time to a text file, that will be named DDMMYYYY.txt for each day, and then
the files will be pushed to this repository automatically through Windows Task Scheduler.

Each file will contain: 
DDMMYYYY - Date
HHMMSS - Time (24Hour)
12011 - Random Number

Update 19/09/2021 - Going to archive this repo, as I forgot to keep the task running each day, and it lapsed in the uploads...
Everything still works, but I just can't be bothered to keep it running all the time.
